# Git
``practice in git``
_Git_ was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Linus was the creator of the Linux operating system and he wanted a version control system that was fast, efficient, and could handle large projects like the Linux kernel 12. Before Git, the Linux kernel project used a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. However, in 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the toolâ€™s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper 1. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:

Speed
Simple design
Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
Fully distributed
Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities 1.
